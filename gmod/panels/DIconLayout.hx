    DIconLayout is what replaced DPanelList in Garry's Mod 13. DPanelList still exists in GMod but is deprecated and does not support the new GWEN skin. 
	
	DIconLayout is used to make a list of panels. Unlike DPanelList, DIconLayout does not automatically add a scroll bar - the example below shows you how you can do this.
