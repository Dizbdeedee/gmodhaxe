    The os library is a standard Lua library originally intended to allow Lua access to various features of the Operating System it's running on, however many of the features and functions have been removed in Garry's Mod due to security issues. It's only used in Garry's Mod for date & time operations.

		`format` | The format string. If this is equal to '*t' or '!*t' then this function will return a DateData structure, otherwise it will return a string. If this starts with an '!', the returned data will use the UTC timezone rather than the local timezone. See http://www.mkssoftware.com/docs/man3/strftime.3.asp for available format flags.

		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		This will use the os.time() function, and return it in a friendly way. os.time() is useful for storing as a date stamp but needs this to make it readable.
		
		```lua 
		local Timestamp = os.time()
		local TimeString = os.date( "%H:%M:%S -Â %d/%m/%Y" , Timestamp )
		print( "Timestamp:", Timestamp )
		print( "TimeString:", TimeString )
