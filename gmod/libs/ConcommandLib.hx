        Removes a console command.
		
		**Bug:** BUG This will not always remove the command from auto-complete. Issue Tracker: #1183
		
		**Bug:** BUG concommand.Add will fail if the concommand was previously removed with this function in a different realm (creating a command on the client that was removed from the server and vice-versa). Issue Tracker: #1183
		
		Name | Description

		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		Removes the built-in concommand "gmod_camera" which would normally quickly select the camera swep
		
		```lua 
		concommand.Remove("gmod_camera")
		```

        Creates a console command that runs a function in lua with optional autocompletion function and help text.
		
		**Bug:** BUG This will fail if the concommand was previously removed with concommand.Remove in a different realm (creating a command on the client that was removed from the server and vice-versa). Issue Tracker: #1183
		
		Name | Description
		--- | ---
		`name` | The command name to be used in console. This cannot be a name of existing console command or console variable. It will silently fail if it is.
		`callback` | The function to run when the concommand is executed. Arguments passed are: Player ply - The player that ran the concommand. NULL entity if command was entered with the dedicated server console. string cmd - The concommand string (if one callback is used for several concommands). table args - A table of all string arguments. string argStr - The arguments as a string.
		`autoComplete` | The function to call which should return a table of options for autocompletion. (Autocompletion Tutorial) This only properly works on the client since it is not networked. Arguments passed are: string cmd - The concommand this autocompletion is for. string args - The arguments typed so far.
		`helpText` | The text to display should a user run 'help cmdName'.
		`flags` | Concommand modifier flags. See FCVAR_ Enums.
		
		
		___
		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		Adds a concommand killyourself which will kill the user.
		
		```lua 
		concommand.Add("killyourself",function( ply, cmd, args )
		    ply:Kill()
		    print("You killed yourself!")
		end)
		```
		
		#### Example 2
		A concommand that prints the SteamID and nickname of every player on the server.
		
		```lua 
		concommand.Add( "retrieveplayers", function()  
		    for _, ply in ipairs( player.GetAll() ) do
		        print( ply:Nick() .. ", " .. ply:SteamID() .. "\n" )
		    end
		end)
