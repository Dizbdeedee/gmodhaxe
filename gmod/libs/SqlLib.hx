/**
    The SQL library allows you to access powerful database software included with Garry's Mod. It is the preferred and fastest method of storing large amounts of data. The database is located in sv.db serverside and cl.db clientside, both in the Garry's Mod base folder. SQL is a whole scripting language in itself although relatively simple, it's something you'll need to read up on before using this library.
