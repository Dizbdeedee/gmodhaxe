		**Bug:** BUG Because this method uses miles per hour but Vehicle:GetVehicleParams returns Hammer units per second, this method incorrectly modifies the vehicle engine's "boostMaxSpeed", "maxRevSpeed" and "maxSpeed" even when not explicitly set in a call to this method. Workaround: In order to retain the original values for these fields, call Vehicle:GetVehicleParams yourself, convert the mentioned fields from Hammer units per second to miles per hour (1 MPH â‰ˆ 17.6 HU/s in this case) and add them to the table passed into the call to this setter. Avoid doing this repeatedly to avoid floating point inaccuracies over time (store the ready-calculated value for next time if possible). Issue Tracker: #2625
