		#### Example 2
		How you could create a clientside only chat command.
		
		```lua 
		hook.Add( "OnPlayerChat", "HelloCommand", function( ply, strText, bTeam, bDead ) 
		    if ( ply != LocalPlayer() ) then return end

		        print("Hello world!") -- print Hello world to the console
		        return true -- this suppresses the message from being shown

		**Output:**

		#### Example 1
		Draws a solid black sphere at where the player is looking at, but not when the skybox is being drawn.You can see why this is needed if you disable the skybox check and look into the sky on gm_flatgrass (or any other map where the 3d skybox is below the map) and you will notice 2 spheres and not 1.
		
		```lua 
		hook.Add( "PostDrawTranslucentRenderables", "test", function( bDepth, bSkybox )
		
		    -- If we are drawing in the skybox, bail
		    if ( bSkybox ) then return end

		    render.SetColorMaterial()
