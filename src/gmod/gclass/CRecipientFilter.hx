		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		Adds all players that can see the origin of the map, removes all players, then adds the first player object to the recipient filter, and sends them a message.
		
		```lua 
		function SendMessage()
		 local filter = RecipientFilter()
		 filter:AddPVS(Vector(0,0,0))
