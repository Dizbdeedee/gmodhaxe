Available for start and abort. number pc - The program counter - the bytecode number of the function being recorded (if this a Lua function). Available for start and abort. number otr - start: the parent trace number if this is a side trace, abort: abort code string oex - start: the exit number for the parent trace, abort: abort reason (string) "record": number tr - The trace number. Not available for flush. function func - The function being traced. Available for start and abort. number pc - The program counter - the bytecode number of the function being recorded (if this a Lua function). Available for start and abort. number depth - The depth of the inlining of the current bytecode. "texit": number tr - The trace number. Not available for flush. number ex - The exit number number ngpr - The number of general-purpose and floating point registers that are active at the exit. number nfpr - The number of general-purpose and floating point registers that are active at the exit.
		`event` | The event to hook into.
