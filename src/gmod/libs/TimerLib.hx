		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		Print "Hello World" after 5 seconds.
		
		```lua 
		timer.Simple( 5, function() print( "Hello World" ) end )
		```
		**Output:**
		
		Hello World
		
		#### Example 2
		Spawns 5 zombies and creates a timer.Simple that removes them in 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15 seconds.
		
		```lua 
		for i = 1, 5 do
		    local zombie = ents.Create("npc_zombie")
		    zombie:SetPos( Vector( i*40, 0 , 250 ) )
		    zombie:Spawn()
		
		    timer.Simple( 10 + i, function() zombie:Remove() end  )
		end
		```
		**Output:**
		
		--11 seconds into game 1st zombie disappears --12 seconds into game 2nd zombie disappears etc.

		**Warning:** Timers won't advance while the client is timing out from the server.
		
		**Note:** Timers use CurTime for timing.
		
		Name | Description
		--- | ---
		`identifier` | Identifier of the timer to create. Must be unique. If a timer already exists with the same identifier, that timer will be updated to the new settings and reset.
		`delay` | The delay interval in seconds. If the delay is too small, the timer will fire on the next frame/tick.
		`repetitions` | The number of times to repeat the timer. Enter 0 for infinite repetitions.
		`func` | Function called when timer has finished the countdown.
		
		
		___
		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		Creates a timer that has a 1 second delay and is only ran once ('UniqueName1'), a timer that has a 2 second delay and is ran continuously ('UniqueName2'), etc.This shows the different ways you can interact with functions.
		
		```lua 
		local function PrintSomething( text )
		    print( text )
		end
		
		local function PrintNoArguments()
		    print( "fun with timers!" )
		end
		
		local function CreateSomeTimers( )
		    timer.Create( "UniqueName1", 1, 1, function() print("inside") end )
		    timer.Create( "UniqueName2", 2, 0, function() PrintSomething("outside") end )
		    timer.Create( "UniqueName3", 5, 1, PrintNoArguments )
		end
		hook.Add( "Initialize", "Timer Example", CreateSomeTimers )
		```
		**Output:**
		
		inside -- 1 second outside -- 2 seconds outside -- 4 seconds fun with timers! -- 5 seconds outside -- 6 seconds outside -- 8 seconds
		
		#### Example 2
		Creates a timer that has 0.01 second delay, to demonstrate that the "minimum" delay of a timer is locked at the tickrate period (1/66 seconds).(As the example below shows, by setting the delay rate to 1/100 (0.01 seconds), the difference in time between the iterations of the timer should be 0.01 seconds, but instead, it is 0.149 (1/66) seconds).
		
		```lua 
		local tick = {} 
		local tick_key = 1 
		
		local function MinimumTimerDelay()    
		    local current_time = CurTime() 
		    if tick_key > 1 then 
		        print( "Timer Iteration #" .. tick_key - 1 .. " had a delay of " .. current_time - tick[tick_key - 1])
		    end
		    tick[tick_key] = current_time 
		    tick_key = tick_key + 1    
		end
		
		local function Timer()
		    timer.Create("Timer Delay", (1/100), 10, MinimumTimerDelay ) 
		end
		
		hook.Add("Initialize", "Commence Timers", Timer)
		```
		**Output:**
		
		Timer Iteration #1 had a delay of 0.014999389648438 Timer Iteration #2 had a delay of 0.014999389648438 Timer Iteration #3 had a delay of 0.014999389648438 Timer Iteration #4 had a delay of 0.0150146484375 Timer Iteration #5 had a delay of 0.014999389648438 Timer Iteration #6 had a delay of 0.014999389648438 Timer Iteration #7 had a delay of 0.014999389648438 Timer Iteration #8 had a delay of 0.014999389648438 Timer Iteration #9 had a delay of 0.014999389648438
