		#### Example 1
		See if gmod_tool is based on weapon_base, and whether weapon_base is based on itself.

		**Bug:** BUG Sub-tables provided in the first argument will not carry over their metatable, and will receive a BaseClass key if the table was merged with the base's. Userdata references, which includes Vectors, Angles, Entities, etc. will not be copied. Pull Request: #1300
