		___
		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		Prints all the players currently in the server.
		
		```lua 
		PrintTable( player.GetAll() )
		```
		
		#### Example 2
		Prints the number of players in the server. The same output can be achieved more efficiently with player.GetCount.
		
		```lua 
		print(#player.GetAll())

        Similar to the serverside command "bot", this function creates a new Player bot with the given name. This bot will not obey to the usual "bot_*" commands, and it's the same bot base used in TF2 and CS:S. 
		
		The best way to control the behaviour of a Player bot right now is to use the GM:StartCommand hook and modify its input serverside.
		
		**Note:** Despite this Player being fake, it has to be removed from the server by using Player:Kick and NOT Entity:Remove. Also keep in mind that these bots still use player slots, so you won't be able to spawn them in singleplayer!
		
		**Note:** Any Bot created using this method will be considered UnAuthed by Garry's Mod

		--- | ---
		`botName` | The name of the bot, using an already existing name will append brackets at the end of it with a number pertaining it. Example: "Bot name test", "Bot name test(1)".

		___
		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		Create a bot if that is possible.
		
		```lua 
		local listBots = {}
		
		function CreateBot()
		
		    if (Â !game.SinglePlayer() && player.GetCount() < game.MaxPlayers() ) then 
		
		        local num = #listBots
