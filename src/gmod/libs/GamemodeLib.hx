		The supplied event 'name' must be defined in the active gamemode. Otherwise, nothing will happen - not even hooks added with hook.Add will be called. 
		
		 This is similar to hook.Run and hook.Call, except the hook library will call hooks created with hook.Add even if there is no corresponding gamemode function.

		#### Example 1
		Shows a suicide death notice in Sandbox.

		local ply = Entity(1)
		gamemode.Call( "AddDeathNotice", ply:GetName(), ply:Team(), nil, ply:GetName(), ply:Team() )
