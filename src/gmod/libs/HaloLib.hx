		Name | Description
		--- | ---
		`entities` | A table of entities to add the halo effect to
		`color` | The desired color of the halo. See Color structure
		`blurX` | The strength of the halo's blur on the x axis.
		`blurY` | The strength of the halo's blur on the y axis.
		`passes` | The number of times the halo should be drawn per frame. Increasing this may hinder player FPS.
		`additive` | Sets the render mode of the halo to additive.
		`ignoreZ` | Renders the halo through anything when set to true.

		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		Adds a halo around all props in the map using an O(n) operation and iterating through unseen objects which can be extremely expensive to process.
		
		```lua 
		hook.Add( "PreDrawHalos", "AddPropHalos", function()
		    halo.Add( ents.FindByClass( "prop_physics*" ), Color( 255, 0, 0 ), 5, 5, 2 )
		end )
		```
		**Output:**
		
		All the props on the map will be rendered with a red halo, a blur amount of 5, and two passes.
		
		#### Example 2
		Adds a green halo around all admins.
		
		```lua 
		hook.Add( "PreDrawHalos", "AddStaffHalos", function()
		    local staff = {}
		    local staffcount = 0
		
		    for _, ply in ipairs( player.GetAll() ) do
		        if ( ply:IsAdmin() ) then
		            staffcount = staffcount + 1
		            staff[ staffcount ] = ply
		        end
		    end
		
		    if ( staffcount > 0 ) then
		        halo.Add( staff, Color( 0, 255, 0 ), 0, 0, 2, true, true )
		    end
		end )
		```
