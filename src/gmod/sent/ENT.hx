		### Lua Examples
		#### Example 1
		Example Initialize function
		
		```lua 
		function ENT:Initialize()
		    -- Sets what model to use
		    self:SetModel( "models/props/cs_assault/money.mdl" )
		
		    -- Sets what color to use
		    self:SetColor( Color( 200, 255, 200 ) )
		
		    -- Physics stuff
		    self:SetMoveType( MOVETYPE_VPHYSICS )
		    self:SetSolid( SOLID_VPHYSICS )
		
		    -- Init physics only on server, so it doesn't mess up physgun beam
		    if ( SERVER ) then self:PhysicsInit( SOLID_VPHYSICS ) end
		    
		    -- Make prop to fall on spawn
		    local phys = self:GetPhysicsObject()
		    if ( IsValid( phys ) ) then phys:Wake() end
		end
		```
		
		#### Example 2
		Fixes the function not being called clientside.
		
		```lua 
		function SWEP:Initialize()
		    self.m_bInitialized = true
		
		    -- Other code
		end
		
		function SWEP:Think()
		    if (not self.m_bInitialized) then
