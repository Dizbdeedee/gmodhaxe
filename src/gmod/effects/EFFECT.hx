/**
    These hooks are used inside of a Lua effect. Lua effects are stored in either the /lua/effects directory or in a gamemode in /gamemodes/<gamemodename>/entities/effects. 
	
	Effects are entities with the class CLuaEffect, and as such, Entity functions are usable on them (using the self argument). 
	
	 An EFFECT is made using either a combination of the EFFECT:Init, EFFECT:Render and optionally the EFFECT:Think hook. Another way is to create all particles in one go in the Init hook and don't use the other hooks at all.
